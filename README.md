# Git-Commands

Git is a set of command line utility programs that are designed to execute on a Unix style command-line environment.

* Git is the most commonly used version control system. 
* Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. 
* Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.
